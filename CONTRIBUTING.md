# CONTRIBUTING

this project uses typecript only for the benefits of the syntax type annotations, otherwise I would just use JSDoc because I find ts a pain in the ass. I do not use linting eslint and whatever else, so yeah. it is what it is

# add contributing guidelines
- auto formmating/prettier/eslint settings? I don't even use this shit
  - please don't go using prettier and breaking all of the formmating around the code base
  - if a line needs to be long leave it long
  -
- 2 space tabs
- double quotes for strings
- single quotes for chars
- don't be afraid of big files, no need to split a component in 15 different files and directories, have some common sense
-
- and last but more importantly: make use of goHorse whenever necessary
