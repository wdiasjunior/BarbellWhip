# CONTRIBUTING

This is a hobby project that started out just for personal use and has grown into something I'd like to share with everyone.

If you find a bug, feel free to open an issue/and or a PR straight away.

Please open an issue to discuss new features and/or feature behavior changes before submitting a pull request.

I used TypeScript for this project mainly for the benefits of the syntax type annotations and self documented code, since I personally find it to be a pain to work with whenever types get too complex. That being said, I've typed most of the stuff that I judged necessary, but don't expect exquisite types with generics and all that stuff, so you might find squiggly lines around the codebase, but don't worry too much about it.

## Guidelines

Before submitting a PR make sure that your Prettier configs did not format any of the already existing code.

Use 2 space tabs.

Use double quotes for strings, and single quotes for chars.

If a line needs to be long, it's ok, let it be long.

Don't be afraid of big files/functions, no need to split a component into 15 different files and directories. Let your commom sense guide you.

Comments are appreciated. If you think a piece of code got way too complex, try to refactor it first, then if there really is no other way around it, leave some words of wisdom to the next person.

Keep politics of any kind away from this project. I just want to lift some weights.
