# CONTRIBUTING

This is a hobby project that started out just for personal use and has grown into something I'd like to share with everyone.

If you found a bug, fell free to open an issue/and or a PR straight away.

Please open an issue to discuss new features and/or feature behavior changes before submitting a pull request.

This project uses TypeScript only for the benefits of the syntax type annotations, otherwise I would just use JSDoc, since I personally find TypeScript to a pain in the ass whenever types get too complex and prop drilling happens.

I do not use a linter or Prettier. Because of this you might find a bunch of squiggly lines around the codebase. It is what it is. I have added some types here and there for the parts that are a bit more complicated and to remove some of the errors your editor might throw at you, but its mainly for documentation. So don't expect much and don't take them too seriously.

## Guidelines

Before submitting a PR make sure that your Prettier configs did not format any of the already existing code.

Use 2 space tabs.

Use double quotes for strings, and single quotes for chars.

If a line needs to be long, it's ok, let it be long.

Don't be afraid of big files/functions, no need to split a component into 15 different files and directories. Let your commom sense guide you.

Comments are appreciated. If you think a piece of code got way too complex, try to refactor it first, then if there really is no other way around it, leave some words of wisdom to the next person.

Keep politics of any kind away from this project. I just want to lift some weights.

And lastly but most importantly: make use of eXtreme Go Horse whenever necessary.
